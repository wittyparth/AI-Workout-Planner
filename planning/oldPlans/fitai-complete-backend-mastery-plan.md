# üèóÔ∏è FitAI Complete Backend Mastery Plan
## *From Zero to Senior Backend Engineer Through Real Problems*

---

## üéØ **Learning Philosophy: Problem-First Development**

This plan follows the **"Build ‚Üí Break ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Learn"** methodology where you:
1. **Build basic functionality** without knowing "best practices"
2. **Encounter real problems** that force you to research solutions
3. **Learn patterns naturally** when you actually need them
4. **Evolve architecture organically** based on real requirements

**Result:** You'll have the experience and decision-making skills of a senior engineer, not just memorized syntax.
