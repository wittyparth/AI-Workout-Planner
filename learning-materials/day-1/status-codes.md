Perfect! Let’s make a **clean, structured list of the most important HTTP status codes**, so you know what each one means, when to use it, and what’s common in APIs. I’ll correct and clarify the ones you mentioned.

---

# **1️⃣ Success Codes (2xx)**

| Code | Name       | When to use / Meaning                                 |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | OK         | Standard success for GET/POST/PUT, request succeeded  |
| 201  | Created    | Resource successfully created (usually POST)          |
| 204  | No Content | Request succeeded but no response body (often DELETE) |

# **2️⃣ Client Errors (4xx)**

| Code | Name               | Meaning / When to use                                 |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad Request        | Client sent invalid data / malformed request          |
| 401  | Unauthorized       | Auth missing or invalid (JWT, token, session)         |
| 403  | Forbidden          | Auth valid, but client **cannot access resource**     |
| 404  | Not Found          | Resource doesn’t exist (your 404)                     |
| 405  | Method Not Allowed | Client used HTTP method not allowed on endpoint       |
| 409  | Conflict           | Resource conflict (e.g., duplicate entry)             |
| 429  | Too Many Requests  | Client exceeded rate limit (not 529 — you were close) |
| 418  | I’m a teapot       | Fun one, usually ignored — can be used in testing     |

> ⚠️ Note: CORS errors are **not a real HTTP code**. Browser shows them as 0 or blocked — the server usually returns 200/403/404, but the browser prevents the response.

# **3️⃣ Server Errors (5xx)**

| Code | Name                  | Meaning / When to use                       |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Generic server error (your 500)             |
| 501  | Not Implemented       | Endpoint not implemented yet                |
| 502  | Bad Gateway           | Server acting as proxy got invalid response |
| 503  | Service Unavailable   | Server overloaded or down                   |
| 504  | Gateway Timeout       | Proxy timed out waiting for upstream server |

# ✅ Quick rules to remember

1. **2xx** → success (200, 201, 204)
2. **4xx** → client mistake (400, 401, 403, 404, 429)
3. **5xx** → server mistake (500, 502, 503)
4. **Rate limiting** → **429**, not 529
5. **CORS errors** → browser blocks it; HTTP code can vary

If you want, I can also make a **“cheat sheet” table of 15–20 essential codes with real-life API examples** — so you can memorize and know exactly when to use each in your Node.js/Express app.

Do you want me to make that cheat sheet?
